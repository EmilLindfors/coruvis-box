# Codesandbox Rust Visualization

I watched Amos Video and wanted to try it out in codesandbox, so i forked it and opened it.
Then I added som additional information like memory usage , disk usage and running tasks. 

You might think that fetching all that information every 200 milliseconds is going to be a struggle for a poor little vm? Not really, the program itself consumes maybe 5 Mb of memory and 5% CPU, as you can see from the vis.
