# Codesandbox Rust Visualization

![Screenshot from codesandbox](/screenshot.PNG?raw=true "Screenshot")

I watched Fasterthanlime's Video tutorial on displaying realtime cpu stats with rust and axum and wanted to try it out in codesandbox, so i forked it and opened it.
Then I added som additional information like memory usage , disk usage and running tasks. 

Original repo: https://github.com/fasterthanlime/axact and accompanying video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_5Jy_AVDaM

Code is messy, im just trying stuff out for now but you can see it live here:
